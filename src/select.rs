// Local drag-selection for mirror panes.
//
// herdr cannot do this for us. Its native selection only anchors when the pane
// has *no* mouse mode set (`AppState::handle_mouse` forwards the press and
// clears the selection otherwise), while the wheel only reaches a pane as a
// mouse report when at least one mode *is* set. Those are complementary
// conditions, so releasing the grab to get selection costs the wheel: it falls
// back to alternate scroll, which types one cursor key per notch into whatever
// is running (in an agent CLI, that walks the prompt history).
//
// So selection has to be ours. The streamer already receives every press, drag
// and release as SGR bytes while the grab is held, and it already owns the grid
// it painted, which means it has everything it needs: it can track the drag,
// highlight the span, and copy the text without herdr ever learning a selection
// happened. The wheel keeps its existing semantic-scroll path untouched.
//
// The part that makes this safe for *every* remote TUI, not just the ones that
// ignore the mouse, is that a press is deferred rather than stolen. Press and
// release carry different information and only the release says which gesture
// this was:
//
//     press    → buffer the raw bytes, start a tentative selection
//     drag     → the pointer left its cell, so this is a selection
//     release  → moved? copy it, the app sees nothing.
//                still? it was a click: replay press+release to the app.
//
// So lazygit keeps click-to-stage and htop keeps click-to-sort, because those
// are clicks and clicks still arrive. What they lose is the in-app *drag*
// gesture (vim's mouse visual-select, a TUI's pane-resize handle), which is
// claimed as a selection by definition, and the click now lands on release
// instead of on press. Deferring means there is no list of "apps that ignore
// the mouse" to keep, which is the whole reason this shape was chosen: such a
// list is unbounded, drifts, and fails silently when it is wrong.
//
// The grab is always held, including at a shell, so the wheel reaches us as
// terminal.scroll (the pane is on the alt screen and has no local scrollback,
// so releasing the grab cannot scroll). Left-button drags therefore use this
// selector at a prompt too. A click that never moved is not replayed to a
// shell — a prompt never enabled mouse reporting, and the bytes would dump
// into it. TUI clicks still replay as before.
